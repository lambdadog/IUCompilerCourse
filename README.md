# IU Compiler Course
My repository for following the [IU Compiler Course for Fall
2021](https://iucompilercourse.github.io/IU-Fall-2021/) (with the
lecture videos from the Fall [2020
course](https://iucompilercourse.github.io/IU-P423-P523-E313-E513-Fall-2020/)).

I'll first be using Racket (as the course suggests) then will attempt
to redo the course in Chez Scheme, as my eventual goal is to reach a
point where I can comfortably hack on the Chez Scheme compiler.

I've copied the textbook for the course (CC-BY-ND-NC licensed) to this
repository as it is hosted on Dropbox and I don't quite trust Dropbox
links to remain valid.

   + As per the README, the author simplified and innovate on the
     compiler designed by Dybvig, so it's substantially different than
     the original goal compiler of the course.
